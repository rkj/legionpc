WELCOME  DAREDEVIL !


     Before you start your adventure, let me introduce you at short the world
you'll live in. You have to know that the action of this game is taking place
in rather  undefined, distant past. It is not although  the story  of a known
world, because  except  people, absolutely  fantastic creature  live here and
magic is an everyday thing. In one word, you've found yourself in the fantasy
land. There is an  enormous area  to  know,  which consists  of vast forests,
mountain  chains, deserts  and steppes full  of wild animals. There  are also
several inhabited settlements.
     
THE AIM OF THE GAME
     
     You start with a group of  five  daredevils. The game does not impose on
you any  specific way of  procedure. You may  concetrate  on the adventurous
part of the game which  means to  wander about  the land, to visit the towns,
talk and trade with the inhabitants, hunt and oppose to dangers. When you know
this  world  you  can attempt  to conquer a weak  settlement  which  you would
develop and make stronger. You would  form and arm  new legions  there, which
will conquer new settlements for you. You will  create a  realm.  Three other
rulers except you will be realizing the same  aim. You will meet their armies
on your way.  Final  war  with  them  will  be unavoidable.  Soon one and the
biggest threat  will appear,  not  only for you  but  for  the whole land. To
defeat it will be the final challenge. You can be sure that every  contest is
unrepeatable and on the basis of the events  you  will take part in one could
write quite a good story.
